## Concept

This workshop aims at giving early career researchers in social sciences a basic knowledge of open access (OA) publishing and introducing them to useful tools. We address questions such as: What are the limitations of the closed publication system? What is OA publishing? What are the different types of OA publications? What are the available licenses for OA publications? What is the share of OA publications in the scientific literature and how is this changing over time? What sort of funding is available for OA publishing? The workshop is structured around a 45 minute presentation punctuated by group discussions and exercises. 90 minutes are planned for the whole workshop.
